IO/primitives
- No types for now (many complications!)
- u64, u64 math, "math" works on u64 as well as channels
- IO can be done with channels that read/write u64
  - e.g. cat = !stdin(c).stdout<c>.0
    - send/recv never inspect the values so it's fine
    - stdin/stdout will correctly format their results/inputs

Compilation
- FV for liveness analysis
- Register allocation using global register variables
- Spill into C locals
- gt_go_alloca(void f(void), size_t m, size_t n)
  - Use to pass spilled free variables on to forked processes
  - Max stack size n
  - Local stack size m for initial stack frame of f i.e. initial stack is
      &f
      .
      .   m bytes
      .
      &gt_stop
  - f must (sub $m, %rsp) before ret
