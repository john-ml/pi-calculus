# π-calculus

Emits C code and leaves the rest to gcc.

`cabal run` to build and view command line options.

Fun facts:
- The runtime uses green threads for concurrency, based on
    [this tutorial](https://c9x.me/articles/gthreads/code0.html).
- Communication channels contain a small buffer to allow for 
    multiple threads to make progress even if they all write to the same channel.
    Attempting to read from an empty buffer/write to a full buffer adds the
    current thread to a wait queue, and the waiting thread won't be scheduled until
    it's able to make progress again.
- We perform register allocation: gcc is good at this, but stack locals that need
    to be kept alive across forks have to be explicitly copied from one thread's stack
    to another's. All callee-save registers are reserved for π-calculus locals and
    a naive heuristic tells the allocator to avoid spilling variables that are live
    across many forks.
- Floating ν inwards: since there aren't any mutable variables or complicated
    control flow constructs, liveness analysis is basically the free variable function.
    To make the liveness info generated by the free variable function more precise,
    all νs are floated inwards as far as possible.

Todo:
- Hooking up π-calculus channels with real IO channels
- Primitive `u64` values and operations on `u64`s
